## Pictures in the editor: decoded and scaled with pixie, handed to the driver
## as finished pixels.
##
## The X11 driver focim runs on on Linux does not decode pictures, and it
## should not have to. An editor that shows a PNG named in a markdown file is
## asking for a decoder, not for a driver rewrite, and a decoder that lives in
## a driver is a decoder every application linking uirelays pays for whether
## or not it ever shows a picture. So the three image relays are filled in
## here instead, on top of the one thing the driver does offer for this:
## `blitRGBA`, which takes finished pixels and hands back its clip rectangle
## and its frame's dirty tracking in return for going through it.
##
## Nothing here is X11's. A driver that offers `blitRGBA` and has no decoder
## of its own gets pictures the moment it offers it, and a driver that brings
## its own -- the figdraw ones, Cocoa -- keeps them: `installPixieImages`
## looks before it overwrites.
